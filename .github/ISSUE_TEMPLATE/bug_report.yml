        Minimal code snippet to reproduce the bug.
        
        **IMPORTANT!** It should:
        - include all code needed to reproduce the issue
        - include all required imports
        - be self-contained - without references to any code outside
        - be as small as possible, without unrelated code from your project
        
        It should be possible to copy-paste the code and run it as-is.
